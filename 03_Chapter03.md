# Chapter 3: Creating an Amazon Seller Account

Welcome back dear readers to our comprehensive guide on `How to do Amazon FBA`. In the previous chapter, we discussed the importance of product research and sourcing, and various tips and techniques to find the right product to sell through Amazon FBA.

Now that you've identified the product to sell, it's time to set up your Amazon seller account. This chapter will guide you through the process of creating an Amazon seller account and setting up your product listings.

But wait, before we dive into the details of creating the account, let's welcome a special guest. None other than the founder of Amazon himself, **Jeff Bezos**. Here's a quote from the man himself about the importance of selling on Amazon:

> "The balance of power is shifting toward consumers and away from companies...The right way to respond to this if you are a company is to put the vast majority of your energy, attention and dollars into building a great product or service and put a smaller amount into shouting about it, marketing it. If I build a great product or service, my customers will tell each other."

Now that you've heard from the man who created this e-commerce giant, let's get started with the process of setting up your seller account.

To create an Amazon seller account, follow the steps outlined below:

1. Go to the Amazon Seller Central website ([https://sellercentral.amazon.com/](https://sellercentral.amazon.com/)) and click on the "Register now" button.

2. Sign in to your existing Amazon account or create a new one if you don't have one already.

3. Once you're logged in, you'll need to provide some basic information about your business, such as your business name, address, phone number, and email address.

4. Next, you'll be asked to provide information about the products you plan to sell, including the category they fall under and any necessary documentation such as invoices.

5. After you've provided all the necessary information, you'll need to provide your billing information and select a selling plan. Amazon offers two selling plans: "Individual" and "Professional". The Individual plan charges a fee per item sold while the Professional plan charges a monthly subscription fee.

6. Finally, accept the terms and conditions of the Amazon Services Business Solutions Agreement, and you're all set! You can now start listing your products on Amazon and start selling.
